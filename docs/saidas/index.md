# Generated outputs

Everything Reversa produces goes to the `_reversa_sdd/` folder (or whatever name you configure in `config.toml`). The legacy project is never touched.

The set of artifacts generated depends on the **documentation level** chosen at the start of the analysis:

| Legend | Level |
|--------|-------|
| *(all)* | Generated at all 3 levels |
| *(complete+)* | Only at `complete` and `detailed` levels |
| *(detailed)* | Only at `detailed` level |

## Addenda: keeping the extraction current

An extraction is a photograph of the system at a given moment. As soon as a forward feature is delivered, the code moves on and `architecture.md` and `domain.md` start describing a system that no longer exists.

`/reversa-sync` closes that gap without touching the original artifacts. It distills the delivered feature into an addendum under `addenda/`, one file per feature, carrying:

- a **validity** section, saying the addendum holds until the next full re-extraction
- the delta introduced by the feature, drawn from `legacy-impact.md` and `regression-watch.md`
- pointers to the extraction sections that drifted, so whoever reads them knows to read the addendum too

The next full `/reversa` run absorbs the change and marks the addendum as superseded. Nothing in the extraction is ever rewritten in place.

---

## Traceability

Two files connect everything:

**`traceability/code-spec-matrix.md`:** maps each code file to its corresponding spec, with coverage level. You know what's covered and what isn't.

**`traceability/spec-impact-matrix.md`:** maps which component impacts which. Before changing something, you know the blast radius of the change.

---

## What not to commit

Suggested `.gitignore` to avoid versioning Reversa outputs alongside code (unless you want to):

```gitignore
# Reversa outputs (optional: remove if you want to version the specs)
_reversa_sdd/

# Personal Reversa configuration (never commit)
.reversa/config.user.toml
```

## Next step

Specs in hand? See [Developing from specs](../desenvolvendo-com-specs.md) for the recommended order to build the system.
